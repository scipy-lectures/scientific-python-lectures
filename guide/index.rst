How to contribute ?
===================

* If you spot typos, unclear or clumsy wording in the lecture notes, please
  help to improve them. Simple text editing can be done by `editing files
  in your GitHub fork
  <https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/>`_ of
  the lecture notes. On every html page of the lecture notes, an **edit**
  button on the top right links to the editable source of the page (you still
  need to create a fork of the project). Edit the source and choose
  "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".

* Choose a topic that is not yet covered and write it up !

  First create a new issue on GitHub to explain the topic which you would
  like to cover, in order to discuss with editors and contributors about
  the scope of the future tutorial.

  Then create a new directory inside one of the chapters directories
  (``intro``, ``advanced``, or ``packages``) and create a file ``index.rst``
  for the new tutorial. Add the new file in the table of contents of the
  corresponding chapter (in its ``index.rst``).

Keep in mind that tutorials are to be taught at different places and
different parts may be combined into a course on Python for scientific
computing. Thus you want them to be interactive and reasonably short (one
to two hours).

Last but not least, the goal of this material is to provide a concise
text to learn the main features of the scientific Python ecosystem. If
you want to contribute to reference material, we suggest that you
contribute to the documentation of the specific packages that you are
interested in.

Using GitHub
============

The easiest way to make your own version of this teaching material
is to fork it under GitHub, and use the git version control system to
maintain your own fork. For this, all you have to do is create an account
on GitHub and click on the *fork* button, on the top right of `this
page <https://github.com/scipy-lectures/scipy-lecture-notes>`_. You can use git to pull from your *fork*, and push back to it the
changes. If you want to contribute the changes back, just fill a
*pull request*, using the button on the top of your fork's page.

Several resources are available online to learn git and GitHub, such as
https://try.github.io for complete beginners.

Please refrain from modifying the Makefile unless it is absolutely
necessary.

Keeping it concise: collapsing paragraphs
===========================================

The HTML output is used for displaying on screen while teaching. The goal
is to have the same material displayed as in the notes. Thus there needs
to be a very concise display, with bullet-lists rather than full-blown
paragraphs and sentences. For more elaborate discussions that people can
read and refer to, please use the ``tip`` sphinx directive. It creates
collapsible paragraphs, that can be hidden during an oral
presentation::

    .. tip::

        Here insert a full-blown discussion, that will be collapsable in
        the HTML version.

        It can span on multiple paragraphs

This renders as:

    .. tip::

        Here insert a full-blown discussion, that will be collapsable in
        the HTML version.

        It can span on multiple paragraphs

Figures and code examples
==========================

**We do not check figures in the repository**.
Any figure must be generated from a python script that needs to be named
``plot_xxx.py`` (xxx can be anything of course) and put into the ``examples``
directory. The generated image will be named from the script name.

.. image::  auto_examples/images/sphx_glr_plot_simple_001.png
   :target: auto_examples/plot_simple.html


This is the way to include your image and link it to the code:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. image::  auto_examples/images/sphx_glr_plot_simple_001.png
      :target: auto_examples/plot_simple.html

You can display the corresponding code using the ``literal-include``
directive.

.. literalinclude:: examples/plot_simple.py

.. note::

    The transformation of Python scripts into figures and galleries of
    examples is provided by the `sphinx-gallery
    <https://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/>`_ package.

Using Markup
============

There are three main kinds of markup that should be used: *italics*, **bold**
and ``fixed-font``. *Italics* should be used when introducing a new technical
term, **bold** should be used for emphasis and ``fixed-font`` for source code.

.. topic:: Example:

    When using *object-oriented programming* in Python you **must** use the
    ``class`` keyword to define your *classes*.

In restructured-text markup this is::

    when using *object-oriented programming* in Python you **must** use the
    ``class`` keyword to define your *classes*.


Linking to package documentations
==================================

The goal of the Scientific Python Lecture Notes is not to duplicate or replace
the documentation of the various packages. You should link as much as
possible to the original documentation.

For cross-referencing API documentation we prefer to use the `intersphinx
extension <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html#built-in-extensions>`_. This provides
the directives `:mod:`, `:class:` and `:func:` to cross-link to modules,
classes and functions respectively. For example the ``:func:`numpy.var``` will
create a link like :func:`numpy.var`.

Chapter, section, subsection, paragraph
=======================================

Try to avoid to go below paragraph granularity or your document might become
difficult to read:

.. code-block:: rst

   =============
   Chapter title
   =============

   Sample content.

   Section
   =======

   Subsection
   ----------

   Paragraph
   .........

   And some text.


Admonitions
============

.. note::

   This is a note

.. warning::

   This is a warning

Clearing floats
================

Figures positioned with `:align: right` are float. To flush them, use::

    |clear-floats|
