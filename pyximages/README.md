# Content of directory pyximages

This directory contains files related to schematic drawings in the
Scientific Python
Lecture Notes which cannot be produced by means of matplotlib in a simple way
and for which no source exists in the repository so far. For each image, a
Python source using PyX, a bitmap image for the HTML version, and a PDF
image for the PDF version of the lecture notes are present.

The Python source requires the pip installable PyX package and a TeX
installation. The image sources should compile with PyX version 0.14+. Note
that Python 3 requires at least PyX version 0.13.

The source development of PyX is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/pyx-project/pyx)
and the documentation can be found on the [PyX project page](https://pyx-project.org/).
