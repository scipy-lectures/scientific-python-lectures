Why Python?
------------

The scientist's needs
.......................

* Get data (simulation, experiment control)

* Manipulate and process data.

* Visualize results... to understand what we are doing!

* Communicate results: produce figures for reports or publications,
  write presentations.

Specifications
................

* Rich collection of already existing **bricks** corresponding to classical
  numerical methods or basic actions: we don't want to re-program the
  plotting of a curve, a Fourier transform or a fitting algorithm. Don't
  reinvent the wheel!

* Easy to learn: computer science is neither our job nor our education. We
  want to be able to draw a curve, smooth a signal, do a Fourier transform
  in a few minutes.

* Easy communication with collaborators, students, customers, to make the code
  live within a lab or a company: the code should be as readable as a book.
  Thus, the language should contain as few syntax symbols or unneeded routines
  as possible that would divert the reader from the mathematical or scientific
  understanding of the code.

* Efficient code that executes quickly... but needless to say that a very fast
  code becomes useless if we spend too much time writing it. So, we need both a
  quick development time and a quick execution time.

* A single environment/language for everything, if possible, to avoid learning
  a new software for each new problem.

Existing solutions
...................

Which solutions do scientists use to work?

**Compiled languages: C, C++, Fortran, etc.**

* Advantages:

  * Very fast. Very optimized compilers. For heavy computations, it's difficult
    to outperform these languages.

  * Some very optimized scientific libraries have been written for these
    languages. Example: BLAS (vector/matrix operations)

* Drawbacks:

  * Painful usage: no interactivity during development,
    mandatory compilation steps, verbose syntax (&, ::, }}, ; etc.),
    manual memory management (tricky in C). These are **difficult
    languages** for non computer scientists.

**Scripting languages: Matlab**

* Advantages:

  * Very rich collection of libraries with numerous algorithms, for many
    different domains. Fast execution because these libraries are often written
    in a compiled language.

  * Pleasant development environment: comprehensive and well organized help,
    integrated editor, etc.

  * Commercial support is available.

* Drawbacks:

  * Base language is quite poor and can become restrictive for advanced users.

  * Not free.

**Other scripting languages: Scilab, Octave, Igor, R, IDL, etc.**

* Advantages:

  * Open-source, free, or at least cheaper than Matlab.

  * Some features can be very advanced (statistics in R, figures in Igor, etc.)

* Drawbacks:

  * Fewer available algorithms than in Matlab, and the language
    is not more advanced.

  * Some software are dedicated to one domain. Ex: Gnuplot or xmgrace
    to draw curves. These programs are very powerful, but they are
    restricted to a single type of usage, such as plotting.

**What about Python?**

* Advantages:

  * Very rich scientific computing libraries (a bit less than Matlab,
    though)

  * Well thought out language, allowing to write very readable and well
    structured code: we "code what we think".

  * Many libraries for other tasks than scientific computing (web server
    management, serial port access, etc.)

  * Free and open-source software, widely spread, with a vibrant community.

* Drawbacks:

  * less pleasant development environment than, for example, Matlab. (More
    geek-oriented).

  * Not all the algorithms that can be found in more specialized
    software or toolboxes.

Scientific Python building blocks
-----------------------------------

Unlike Matlab, Scilab or R, Python does not come with a pre-bundled set
of modules for scientific computing. Below are the basic building blocks
that can be combined to obtain a scientific computing environment:

* **Python**, a generic and modern computing language

    * Python language: data types (``string``, ``int``), flow control,
      data collections (lists, dictionaries), patterns, etc.

    * Modules of the standard library.

    * A large number of specialized modules or applications written in
      Python: web protocols, web framework, etc. ... and scientific
      computing.

    * Development tools (automatic testing, documentation generation)

The interactive workflow: IPython and a text editor
-----------------------------------------------------

**Interactive work to test and understand algorithms:** In this section, we
describe an interactive workflow with `IPython <http://ipython.org>`__ that is
handy to explore and understand algorithms.

Python is a general-purpose language. As such, there is not one blessed
environment to work in, and not only one way of using it. Although
this makes it harder for beginners to find their way, it makes it
possible for Python to be used to write programs, in web servers, or
embedded devices.

.. note:: Reference document for this section:

    **IPython user manual:** http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/index.html

Command line interaction
..........................

Start `ipython`:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [1]: print('Hello world')
    Hello world

Getting help by using the **?** operator after an object:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [2]: print?
    Type:		builtin_function_or_method
    Base Class:	        <type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
    String Form:	<built-in function print>
    Namespace:	        Python builtin
    Docstring:
	print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout)

	Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
	Optional keyword arguments:
	file: a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
	sep:  string inserted between values, default a space.
	end:  string appended after the last value, default a newline.


Elaboration of the algorithm in an editor
..........................................

Create a file `my_file.py` in a text editor. Under EPD (Enthought Python
Distribution), you can use `Scite`, available from the start menu. Under
Python(x,y), you can use Spyder. Under Ubuntu, if you don't already have your
favorite editor, we would advise installing `Stani's Python editor`. In the
file, add the following lines::

    s = 'Hello world'
    print(s)

Now, you can run it in IPython and explore the resulting variables:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [1]: %run my_file.py
    Hello world

    In [2]: s
    Out[2]: 'Hello world'

    In [3]: %whos
    Variable   Type    Data/Info
    ----------------------------
    s          str     Hello world


.. topic:: **From a script to functions**

    While it is tempting to work only with scripts, that is a file full
    of instructions following each other, do plan to progressively evolve
    the script to a set of functions:

    * A script is not reusable, functions are.

    * Thinking in terms of functions helps breaking the problem in small
      blocks.


IPython Tips and Tricks
.......................

The IPython user manual contains a wealth of information about using IPython,
but to get you started we want to give you a quick introduction to three useful
features: *history*, *magic functions*, *aliases* and *tab completion*.

Like a UNIX shell, IPython supports command history. Type *up* and *down* to
navigate previously typed commands:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [1]: x = 10

    In [2]: <UP>

    In [2]: x = 10

IPython supports so called *magic* functions by prefixing a command with the
``%`` character. For example, the ``run`` and ``whos`` functions from the
previous section are magic functions. Note that, the setting ``automagic``,
which is enabled by default, allows you to omit the preceding ``%`` sign. Thus,
you can just type the magic function and it will work.

Other useful magic functions are:

* ``%cd`` to change the current directory.

  .. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [2]: cd /tmp
    /tmp

* ``%timeit`` allows you to time the execution of short snippets using the
  ``timeit`` module from the standard library:

  .. sourcecode:: ipython

      In [3]: timeit x = 10
      10000000 loops, best of 3: 39 ns per loop

* ``%cpaste`` allows you to paste code, especially code from websites which has
  been prefixed with the standard python prompt (e.g. ``>>>``) or with an ipython
  prompt, (e.g. ``in [3]``):

  .. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [5]: cpaste
    Pasting code; enter '--' alone on the line to stop or use Ctrl-D.
    :In [3]: timeit x = 10
    :--
    10000000 loops, best of 3: 85.9 ns per loop
    In [6]: cpaste
    Pasting code; enter '--' alone on the line to stop or use Ctrl-D.
    :>>> timeit x = 10
    :--
    10000000 loops, best of 3: 86 ns per loop


* ``%debug`` allows you to enter post-mortem debugging. That is to say, if the
  code you try to execute, raises an exception, using ``%debug`` will enter the
  debugger at the point where the exception was thrown.

  .. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [7]: x === 10
      File "<ipython-input-6-12fd421b5f28>", line 1
        x === 10
            ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax


    In [8]: debug
    > /home/esc/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/compilerop.py(87)ast_parse()
         86         and are passed to the built-in compile function."""
    ---> 87         return compile(source, filename, symbol, self.flags | PyCF_ONLY_AST, 1)
         88

    ipdb>locals()
    {'source': u'x === 10\n', 'symbol': 'exec', 'self':
    <IPython.core.compilerop.CachingCompiler instance at 0x2ad8ef0>,
    'filename': '<ipython-input-6-12fd421b5f28>'}

.. note::


.. note::

    The built-in IPython cheat-sheet is accessible via the ``%quickref`` magic
    function.

.. note::

    A list of all available magic functions is shown when typing ``%magic``.

Furthermore IPython ships with various *aliases* which emulate common UNIX
command line tools such as ``ls`` to list files, ``cp`` to copy files and ``rm`` to
remove files. A list of aliases is shown when typing ``alias``:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [1]: alias
    Total number of aliases: 16
    Out[1]:
    [('cat', 'cat'),
    ('clear', 'clear'),
    ('cp', 'cp -i'),
    ('ldir', 'ls -F -o --color %l | grep /$'),
    ('less', 'less'),
    ('lf', 'ls -F -o --color %l | grep ^-'),
    ('lk', 'ls -F -o --color %l | grep ^l'),
    ('ll', 'ls -F -o --color'),
    ('ls', 'ls -F --color'),
    ('lx', 'ls -F -o --color %l | grep ^-..x'),
    ('man', 'man'),
    ('mkdir', 'mkdir'),
    ('more', 'more'),
    ('mv', 'mv -i'),
    ('rm', 'rm -i'),
    ('rmdir', 'rmdir')]

Lastly, we would like to mention the *tab completion* feature, whose
description we cite directly from the IPython manual:

*Tab completion, especially for attributes, is a convenient way to explore the
structure of any object youâre dealing with. Simply type object_name.<TAB> to
view the objectâs attributes. Besides Python objects and keywords, tab
completion also works on file and directory names.*

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [1]: x = 10

    In [2]: x.<TAB>
    x.bit_length   x.conjugate    x.denominator  x.imag         x.numerator
    x.real

    In [3]: x.real.
    x.real.bit_length   x.real.denominator  x.real.numerator
    x.real.conjugate    x.real.imag         x.real.real

    In [4]: x.real.
