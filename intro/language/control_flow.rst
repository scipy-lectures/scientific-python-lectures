Control Flow
============

Controls the order in which the code is executed.

if/elif/else
------------

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    >>> if 2**2 == 4:
    ...     print 'Obvious!'
    ...
    Obvious!


**Blocks are delimited by indentation**

Type the following lines in your Python interpreter, and be careful to
**respect the indentation depth**. The Ipython shell automatically
increases the indentation depth after a column ``:`` sign; to
decrease the indentation depth, go four spaces to the left with the
Backspace key. Press the Enter key twice to leave the logical block.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [1]: a = 10

    In [2]: if a == 1:
       ...:     print(1)
       ...: elif a == 2:
       ...:     print(2)
       ...: else:
       ...:     print('A lot')
       ...:
    A lot

Indentation is compulsory in scripts as well. As an exercise, re-type the
previous lines with the same indentation in a script ``condition.py``, and
execute the script with ``run condition.py`` in Ipython.

for/range
----------

Iterating with an index::

    >>> for i in range(4):
    ...     print(i)
    0
    1
    2
    3

But most often, it is more readable to iterate over values::

    >>> for word in ('cool', 'powerful', 'readable'):
    ...     print('Python is %s' % word)
    Python is cool
    Python is powerful
    Python is readable


while/break/continue
---------------------

Typical C-style while loop (Mandelbrot problem)::

    >>> z = 1 + 1j
    >>> while abs(z) < 100:
    ...     z = z**2 + 1
    >>> z
    (-134+352j)

**More advanced features**

``break`` out of enclosing for/while loop::

    >>> z = 1 + 1j

    >>> while abs(z) < 100:
    ...     if z.imag == 0:
    ...         break
    ...     z = z**2 + 1


``continue`` the next iteration of a loop.::

    >>> a = [1, 0, 2, 4]
    >>> for element in a:
    ...     if element == 0:
    ...         continue
    ...     print 1. / element
    1.0
    0.5
    0.25



Conditional Expressions
-----------------------

:``if <OBJECT>``:

  Evaluates to False:
    * any number equal to zero (0, 0.0, 0+0j)
    * an empty container (list, tuple, set, dictionary, ...)
    * ``False``, ``None``

  Evaluates to True:
    * everything else

:``a == b``:

  Tests equality, with logics::

    >>> 1 == 1.
    True

:``a is b``:

  Tests identity: both sides are the same object::

    >>> 1 is 1.
    False

    >>> a = 1
    >>> b = 1
    >>> a is b
    True

:``a in b``:

  For any collection ``b``: ``b`` contains ``a`` ::

    >>> b = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> 2 in b
    True
    >>> 5 in b
    False


  If ``b`` is a dictionary, this tests that ``a`` is a key of ``b``.

Advanced iteration
-------------------------

Iterate over any *sequence*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can iterate over any sequence (string, list, keys in a dictionary, lines in
a file, ...)::

    >>> vowels = 'aeiouy'

    >>> for i in 'powerful':
    ...     if i in vowels:
    ...         print(i),
    o e u

::

    >>> message = "Hello how are you?"
    >>> message.split() # returns a list
    ['Hello', 'how', 'are', 'you?']
    >>> for word in message.split():
    ...     print word
    ...
    Hello
    how
    are
    you?

Few languages (in particular, languages for scientific computing) allow to
loop over anything but integers/indices. With Python it is possible to
loop exactly over the objects of interest without bothering with indices
you often don't care about.


.. warning:: Not safe to modify the sequence you are iterating over.

Keeping track of enumeration number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common task is to iterate over a sequence while keeping track of the
item number.

* Could use while loop with a counter as above. Or a for loop::

    >>> words = ('cool', 'powerful', 'readable')
    >>> for i in range(0, len(words)):
    ...     print i, words[i]
    0 cool
    1 powerful
    2 readable

* But, Python provides ``enumerate`` keyword for this::

    >>> for index, item in enumerate(words):
    ...     print index, item
    0 cool
    1 powerful
    2 readable



Looping over a dictionary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use **iteritems**::

    >>> d = {'a': 1, 'b':1.2, 'c':1j}

    >>> for key, val in d.iteritems():
    ...     print('Key: %s has value: %s' % (key, val))
    Key: a has value: 1
    Key: c has value: 1j
    Key: b has value: 1.2

List Comprehensions
-------------------

::

    >>> [i**2 for i in range(4)]
    [0, 1, 4, 9]
