The Python language
=====================================

**Authors**: *Chris Burns, Christophe Combelles, Emmanuelle Gouillart,
GaÃ«l Varoquaux*

.. topic:: Python for scientific computing

    We introduce here the Python language. Only the bare minimum
    necessary for getting started with NumPy and SciPy is addressed here.
    To learn more about the language, consider going through the
    excellent tutorial https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial. Dedicated books
    are also available, such as `Dive into Python 3 <https://diveintopython3.net/>`__.

.. tip::

  Python is a **programming language**, as are C, Fortran, BASIC, PHP,
  etc. Some specific features of Python are as follows:

  * an *interpreted* (as opposed to *compiled*) language. Contrary to e.g.
    C or Fortran, one does not compile Python code before executing it. In
    addition, Python can be used **interactively**: many Python
    interpreters are available, from which commands and scripts can be
    executed.

  * a free software released under an **open-source** license: Python can
    be used and distributed free of charge, even for building commercial
    software.

  * **multi-platform**: Python is available for all major operating
    systems, Windows, Linux/Unix, MacOS X, most likely your mobile phone
    OS, etc.

  * a very readable language with clear non-verbose syntax

  * a language for which a large variety of high-quality packages are
    available for various applications, from web frameworks to scientific
    computing.

  * a language very easy to interface with other languages, in particular C
    and C++.

  * Some other features of the language are illustrated just below. For
    example, Python is an object-oriented language, with dynamic typing
    (the same variable can contain objects of different types during the
    course of a program).

  distinguishing features of Python.
