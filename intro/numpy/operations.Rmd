# Numerical operations on arrays

```{python tags=c("hide-input")}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Elementwise operations

### Basic operations

With scalars:

```{python}
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
a + 1
```

```{python}
2 ** a
```

All arithmetic operates elementwise:

```{python}
b = np.ones(4) + 1
a - b
```

```{python}
a * b
```

```{python}
j = np.arange(5)
2**(j + 1) - j
```

These operations are of course much faster than if you did them in pure python:

```{python}
a = np.arange(10000)
# %timeit a + 1
```

```{python}
l = range(10000)
# %timeit [i+1 for i in l]
```

**Warning: array multiplication is not matrix multiplication**

Consider these examples:

```{python}
c = np.ones((3, 3))
c * c                   # NOT matrix multiplication!
```

**Matrix multiplication:**

```{python}
c @ c
```

- Try simple arithmetic elementwise operations: add even elements
  with odd elements
- Time them against their pure python counterparts using `%timeit`.
- Generate:

  - `[2**0, 2**1, 2**2, 2**3, 2**4]`
  - `a_j = 2^(3*j) - j`

### Other operations

#### Comparisons

```{python}
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
b = np.array([4, 2, 2, 4])
a == b
```

```{python}
a > b
```

Array-wise comparisons:

```{python}
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
b = np.array([4, 2, 2, 4])
c = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
np.array_equal(a, b)
```

```{python}
np.array_equal(a, c)
```

#### Logical operations

```{python}
a = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0], dtype=bool)
b = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0], dtype=bool)
np.logical_or(a, b)
```

```{python}
np.logical_and(a, b)
```

#### Transcendental functions

```{python}
a = np.arange(5)
np.sin(a)
```

```{python}
np.exp(a)
```

```{python}
np.log(np.exp(a))
```

#### Shape mismatches

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
a = np.arange(4)
a + np.array([1, 2])
```

*Broadcasting?* We'll return to that {ref}`later <broadcasting>`.

#### Transposition

```{python}
a = np.triu(np.ones((3, 3)), 1)   # see help(np.triu)
a
```

```{python}
a.T
```

Remember, **the transposition is a view**.

The transpose returns a *view* of the original array:

```{python}
a = np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3)
a.T[0, 2] = 999
a.T
```

```{python}
a
```

#### Linear algebra

The sub-module {mod}`numpy.linalg` implements basic linear algebra, such as
solving linear systems, singular value decomposition, etc. However, it is
not guaranteed to be compiled using efficient routines, and thus we
recommend the use of {mod}`scipy.linalg`, as detailed in section
{ref}`scipy-linalg`

## Basic reductions

### Computing sums

```{python}
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
np.sum(x)
```

```{python}
x.sum()
```

![](images/reductions.png)

Sum by rows and by columns:

```{python}
x = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 2]])
x
```

```{python}
x.sum(axis=0)   # columns (first dimension)
```

```{python}
x[:, 0].sum(), x[:, 1].sum()
```

```{python}
x.sum(axis=1)   # rows (second dimension)
```

```{python}
x[0, :].sum(), x[1, :].sum()
```

Here is the same idea in higher dimensions:

```{python}
rng = np.random.default_rng(27446968)
x = rng.random((2, 2, 2))
x.sum(axis=2)[0, 1]
```

```{python}
x[0, 1, :].sum()
```

### Other reductions

These work the same way (and take `axis=`)

#### Extrema

```{python}
x = np.array([1, 3, 2])
x.min()
```

```{python}
x.max()
```

```{python}
x.argmin()  # index of minimum
```

```{python}
x.argmax()  # index of maximum
```

#### Logical operations

```{python}
np.all([True, True, False])
```

```{python}
np.any([True, True, False])
```

This can be used for array comparisons:

```{python}
a = np.zeros((100, 100))
np.any(a != 0)
```

```{python}
np.all(a == a)
```

```{python}
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 2])
b = np.array([2, 2, 3, 2])
c = np.array([6, 4, 4, 5])
((a <= b) & (b <= c)).all()
```

**Statistics:**

```{python}
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 1])
y = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 1]])
x.mean()
```

```{python}
np.median(x)
```

```{python}
np.median(y, axis=-1) # last axis
```

```{python}
x.std()          # full population standard dev.
```

... and many more (best to learn as you go).

#### Worked Example: diffusion using a random walk algorithm

![](random_walk.png)

Let us consider a simple 1D random walk process: at each time step a
walker jumps right or left with equal probability.

We are interested in finding the typical distance from the origin of a
random walker after `t` left or right jumps? We are going to
simulate many "walkers" to find this law, and we are going to do so
using array computing tricks: we are going to create a 2D array with
the "stories" (each walker has a story) in one direction, and the
time in the other:

![](random_walk_schema.png)

```{python}
n_stories = 1000 # number of walkers
t_max = 200      # time during which we follow the walker
```

We randomly choose all the steps 1 or -1 of the walk:

```{python}
t = np.arange(t_max)
rng = np.random.default_rng()
steps = 2 * rng.integers(0, 1 + 1, (n_stories, t_max)) - 1 # +1 because the high value is exclusive
np.unique(steps) # Verification: all steps are 1 or -1
```

We build the walks by summing steps along the time:

```{python}
positions = np.cumsum(steps, axis=1) # axis = 1: dimension of time
sq_distance = positions**2
```

We get the mean in the axis of the stories:

```{python}
mean_sq_distance = np.mean(sq_distance, axis=0)
```

Plot the results:

```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))
plt.plot(t, np.sqrt(mean_sq_distance), 'g.', t, np.sqrt(t), 'y-')
plt.xlabel(r"$t$")
plt.ylabel(r"$\sqrt{\langle (\delta x)^2 \rangle}$")
plt.tight_layout() # provide sufficient space for labels
```

We find a well-known result in physics: the Root Mean Square (RMS) distance
grows as the square root of the time!

## Interim summary and exercises

| Operation type | Numpy functions              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| arithmetic     | `sum`, `prod`, `mean`, `std` |
| Extrema        | `min`, `max`                 |
| logical        | `all`, `any`                 |

Also, recall the `axis` argument to select the dimension over which an operation will be applied:

```{python}
arr = np.array([[99, 12], [11, 2]])
arr
```

```{python}
# Without axis=, operation applied over whole (flatted, 1D) array.
np.min(arr)
```

```{python}
# Operate along first axis (rows).
np.min(arr, axis=0)
```

```{python}
# Operate along second axis (columns).
np.min(arr, axis=1)
```

(broadcasting)=

## Broadcasting

- Basic operations on `numpy` arrays (addition, etc.) are elementwise

- This works on arrays of the same size.

- **Nevertheless** , it's also possible to do
  operations on arrays of different sizes if
  *NumPy* can transform these arrays so that
  they all have the same size: this conversion
  is called **broadcasting**.

The image below gives an example of broadcasting:

![](images/numpy_broadcasting.png)

Let's verify:

```{python}
a = np.tile(np.arange(0, 40, 10), (3, 1)).T
a
```

```{python}
b = np.array([0, 1, 2])
a + b
```

We have already used broadcasting without knowing it!:

```{python}
a = np.ones((4, 5))
a[0] = 2  # we assign an array of dimension 0 to an array of dimension 1
a
```

A useful trick:

```{python}
a = np.arange(0, 40, 10)
a.shape
```

```{python}
a = a[:, np.newaxis]  # adds a new axis -> 2D array
a.shape
```

```{python}
a
```

```{python}
a + b
```

::: {note}
:class: dropdown

Broadcasting seems a bit magical, but it is actually quite natural to
use it when we want to solve a problem whose output data is an array
with more dimensions than input data.
:::

### Worked Example: Broadcasting

Let's construct an array of distances (in miles) between cities of
Route 66: Chicago, Springfield, Saint-Louis, Tulsa, Oklahoma City,
Amarillo, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Flagstaff and Los Angeles.

```{python}
mileposts = np.array([0, 198, 303, 736, 871, 1175, 1475, 1544,
       1913, 2448])
distance_array = np.abs(mileposts - mileposts[:, np.newaxis])
distance_array
```

![](images/route66.png)

A lot of grid-based or network-based problems can also use
broadcasting. For instance, if we want to compute the distance from
the origin of points on a 5x5 grid, we can do

```{python}
x, y = np.arange(5), np.arange(5)[:, np.newaxis]
distance = np.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
distance
```

Or in color:

```{python}
plt.pcolor(distance)
plt.colorbar()
```

**Remark** : the {func}`numpy.ogrid` function allows to directly create
vectors x and y of the previous example, with two "significant dimensions":

```{python}
x, y = np.ogrid[0:5, 0:5]
x, y
```

```{python}
x.shape, y.shape
distance = np.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
```

So, `np.ogrid` is very useful as soon as we have to handle
computations on a grid. On the other hand, `np.mgrid` directly
provides matrices full of indices for cases where we can't (or don't
want to) benefit from broadcasting:

```{python}
x, y = np.mgrid[0:4, 0:4]
x
```

```{python}
y
```

## Array shape manipulation

### Flattening

```{python}
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
a.ravel()
```

```{python}
a.T
```

```{python}
a.T.ravel()
```

Higher dimensions: last dimensions ravel out "first".

### Reshaping

The inverse operation to flattening:

```{python}
a.shape
```

```{python}
b = a.ravel()
b = b.reshape((2, 3))
b
```

Or,

```{python}
a.reshape((2, -1))    # unspecified (-1) value is inferred
```

:::{warning}
`ndarray.reshape` **may** return a view (cf `help(np.reshape)`)),
or copy
:::

For example, consider:

```{python}
b[0, 0] = 99
a
```

Beware: reshape may also return a copy!:

```{python}
a = np.zeros((3, 2))
b = a.T.reshape(3*2)
b[0] = 9
a
```

To understand this you need to learn more about the memory layout of a NumPy array.

### Adding a dimension

Indexing with the `np.newaxis` object allows us to add an axis to an array
(you have seen this already above in the broadcasting section):

```{python}
z = np.array([1, 2, 3])
z
```

```{python}
z[:, np.newaxis]
```

```{python}
z[np.newaxis, :]
```

### Dimension shuffling

```{python}
a = np.arange(4*3*2).reshape(4, 3, 2)
a.shape
```

```{python}
a[0, 2, 1]
```

```{python}
b = a.transpose(1, 2, 0)
b.shape
```

```{python}
b[2, 1, 0]
```

Also creates a view:

```{python}
b[2, 1, 0] = -1
a[0, 2, 1]
```

### Resizing

Size of an array can be changed with `ndarray.resize`:

```{python}
a = np.arange(4)
a.resize((8,))
a
```

However, it must not be referred to somewhere else:

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
b = a
a.resize((4,))
```

## Sorting data

Sorting along an axis:

```{python}
a = np.array([[4, 3, 5], [1, 2, 1]])
b = np.sort(a, axis=1)
b
```

:::{note}
Sorts each row separately!
:::

In-place sort:

```{python}
a.sort(axis=1)
a
```

Sorting with fancy indexing:

```{python}
a = np.array([4, 3, 1, 2])
j = np.argsort(a)
j
```

```{python}
a[j]
```

Finding minima and maxima:

```{python}
a = np.array([4, 3, 1, 2])
j_max = np.argmax(a)
j_min = np.argmin(a)
j_max, j_min
```

<!---
XXX: need a frame for summaries

* Arithmetic etc. are elementwise operations
* Basic linear algebra, ``@``
* Reductions: ``sum(axis=1)``, ``std()``, ``all()``, ``any()``
* Broadcasting: ``a = np.arange(4); a[:,np.newaxis] + a[np.newaxis,:]``
* Shape manipulation: ``a.ravel()``, ``a.reshape(2, 2)``
* Fancy indexing: ``a[a > 3]``, ``a[[2, 3]]``

## Summary

**What do you need to know to get started?**

- Know how to create arrays : `array`, `arange`, `ones`,
  `zeros`.

- Know the shape of the array with `array.shape`, then use slicing
  to obtain different views of the array: `array[::2]`,
  etc. Adjust the shape of the array using `reshape` or flatten it
  with `ravel`.

- Obtain a subset of the elements of an array and/or modify their values
  with masks, with e.g.:

  ```python
  a[a < 0] = 0
  ```

- Know miscellaneous operations on arrays, such as finding the mean or max
  (`array.max()`, `array.mean()`). No need to retain everything, but
  have the reflex to search in the documentation (online docs,
  `help()`)!!

- For advanced use: master the indexing with arrays of integers, as well as
  broadcasting. Know more NumPy functions to handle various array
  operations.
