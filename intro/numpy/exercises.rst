Some exercises
==============

.. topic:: Worked example: Framing Lena
    :class: green

    Let's do some manipulations on numpy arrays by starting with the
    famous image of Lena (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/).
    ``scipy`` provides a 2D array of this image with the ``scipy.lena``
    function::


        >>> from scipy import misc
        >>> lena = misc.lena()

    **Note:** In older versions of scipy, you will find lena under
    ``scipy.lena()``

    Here are a few images we will be able to obtain with our manipulations:
    use different colormaps, crop the image, change some parts of the image.

    .. image:: images/lenas.png
        :align: center

    * Let's use the imshow function of pylab to display the image.

      .. sourcecode:: ipython

        In [3]: import pylab as plt
        In [4]: lena = misc.lena()
        In [5]: plt.imshow(lena)

    * Lena is then displayed in false colors. A colormap must be
      specified for her to be displayed in grey.

      .. sourcecode:: ipython

        In [6]: plt.imshow(lena, cmap=plt.cm.gray)

    * Create an array of the image with a narrower centering : for example,
      remove 30 pixels from all the borders of the image. To check the result,
      display this new array with ``imshow``.

      .. sourcecode:: ipython

        In [9]: crop_lena = lena[30:-30,30:-30]

    * We will now frame Lena's face with a black locket. For this, we
      need to create a mask corresponding to the pixels we want to be
      black. The mask is defined by this condition ``(y-256)**2 +
      (x-256)**2``

      .. sourcecode:: ipython

         In [15]: y, x = np.ogrid[0:512,0:512] # x and y indices of pixels
         In [16]: y.shape, x.shape
         Out[16]: ((512, 1), (1, 512))
         In [17]: centerx, centery = (256, 256) # center of the image
         In [18]: mask = ((y - centery)**2 + (x - centerx)**2) > 230**2 # circle

      then we assign the value 0 to the pixels of the image corresponding
      to the mask. The syntax is extremely simple and intuitive:

      .. sourcecode:: ipython

         In [19]: lena[mask] = 0
         In [20]: plt.imshow(lena)
         Out[20]: <matplotlib.image.AxesImage object at 0xa36534c>

    * Follow-up: copy all instructions of this exercise in a script called
      ``lena_locket.py`` then execute this script in IPython with ``%run
      lena_locket.py``.

      Change the circle to an ellipsoid.

.. topic:: Exercise: Array manipulations
    :class: green

    1. Form the 2-D array (without typing it in explicitly)::

        [[1,  6, 11],
         [2,  7, 12],
         [3,  8, 13],
         [4,  9, 14],
         [5, 10, 15]]

       and generate a new array containing its 2nd and 4th rows.

    2. Divide each column of the array:

       .. sourcecode:: pycon

        >>> a = np.arange(25).reshape(5, 5)

       elementwise with the array ``b = np.array([1., 5, 10, 15, 20])``.
       (Hint: ``np.newaxis``).

    3. Harder one: Generate a 10 x 3 array of random numbers (in range [0,1]).
       For each row, pick the number closest to 0.5.

       - Use ``abs`` and ``argsort`` to find the column ``j`` closest for
         each row.

       - Use fancy indexing to extract the numbers.  (Hint: ``a[i,j]`` --
         the array ``i`` must contain the row numbers corresponding to stuff in
         ``j``.)

.. topic:: Exercise: Data statistics
   :class: green

   The data in :download:`populations.txt <../../data/populations.txt>`
   describes the populations of hares and lynxes (and carrots) in
   northern Canada during 20 years:

   .. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> data = np.loadtxt('data/populations.txt')
    >>> year, hares, lynxes, carrots = data.T  # trick: columns to variables

    >>> plt.axes([0.2, 0.1, 0.5, 0.8]) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <matplotlib.axes.Axes object at ...>
    >>> plt.plot(year, hares, year, lynxes, year, carrots) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at ...>, ...]
    >>> plt.legend(('Hare', 'Lynx', 'Carrot'), loc=(1.05, 0.5)) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <matplotlib.legend.Legend object at ...>

   .. plot:: pyplots/numpy_intro_7.py

   Computes and print, based on the data in ``populations.txt``...

   1. The mean and std of the populations of each species for the years
      in the period.

   2. Which year each species had the largest population.

   3. Which species has the largest population for each year.
      (Hint: ``argsort`` & fancy indexing of
      ``np.array(['H', 'L', 'C'])``)

   4. Which years any of the populations is above 50000.
      (Hint: comparisons and ``np.any``)

   5. The top 2 years for each species when they had the lowest
      populations. (Hint: ``argsort``, fancy indexing)

   6. Compare (plot) the change in hare population (see
      ``help(np.gradient)``) and the number of lynxes. Check correlation
      (see ``help(np.corrcoef)``).

   ... all without for-loops.

.. topic:: Exercise: Crude integral approximations
   :class: green

   Write a function ``f(a, b, c)`` that returns :math:`a^b - c`.  Form
   a 24x12x6 array containing its values in parameter ranges ``[0,1] x
   [0,1] x [0,1]``.

   Approximate the 3-d integral

   .. math:: \int_0^1\int_0^1\int_0^1(a^b-c)da\,db\,dc

   over this volume with the mean.  The exact result is: :math:`\ln 2 -
   \frac{1}{2}\approx0.1931\ldots` --- what is your relative error?

   (Hints: use elementwise operations and broadcasting.
   You can make ``np.ogrid`` give a number of points in given range
   with ``np.ogrid[0:1:20j]``.)

   **Reminder** Python functions::

       def f(a, b, c):
           return some_result

.. topic:: Exercise: Mandelbrot set
   :class: green

   .. plot:: intro/numpy/solutions/2_4_mandelbrot.py

   Write a script that computes the Mandelbrot fractal. The Mandelbrot
   iteration::

       N_max = 50
       some_threshold = 50

       c = x + 1j*y

       for j in xrange(N_max):
           z = z**2 + c

   Point (x, y) belongs to the Mandelbrot set if :math:`|c|` <
   ``some_threshold``.

   Do this computation by:

   .. For doctests
      >>> mask = np.ones((3, 3))

   1. Construct a grid of c = x + 1j*y values in range [-2, 1] x [-1.5, 1.5]

   2. Do the iteration

   3. Form the 2-d boolean mask indicating which points are in the set

   4. Save the result to an image with::

   .. sourcecode:: pycon

       >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       >>> plt.imshow(mask.T, extent=[-2, 1, -1.5, 1.5]) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
       <matplotlib.image.AxesImage object at ...>
       >>> plt.gray()
       >>> plt.savefig('mandelbrot.png')

   Solution: :download:`Python source file <solutions/2_4_mandelbrot.py>`

.. topic:: Exercise: Markov chain
   :class: green

   .. image:: images/markov-chain.png

   Markov chain transition matrix ``P``, and probability distribution on
   the states ``p``::

   1. ``0 <= P[i,j] <= 1``: probability to go from state ``i`` to state ``j``

   2. Transition rule: :math:`p_{new} = P^T p_{old}`

   3. ``all(sum(P, axis=1) == 1)``, ``p.sum() == 1``: normalization

   Write a script that works with 5 states, and:

   - Constructs a random matrix, and normalizes each row so that it
     is a transition matrix.

   - Starts from a random (normalized) probability distribution
     ``p`` and takes 50 steps => ``p_50``

   - Computes the stationary distribution: the eigenvector of ``P.T``
     with eigenvalue 1 (numerically: closest to 1) => ``p_stationary``

   Remember to normalize the eigenvector --- I didn't...

   - Checks if ``p_50`` and ``p_stationary`` are equal to tolerance 1e-5

   Toolbox: ``np.random.rand``, ``.dot()``, ``np.linalg.eig``,
   reductions, ``abs()``, ``argmin``, comparisons, ``all``,
   ``np.linalg.norm``, etc.
