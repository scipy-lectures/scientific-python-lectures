"""
Test for an education/gender interaction in wages
==================================================

Wages depend mostly on education. Here we investigate how this dependence
is related to gender: not only does gender create an offset in wages, it
also seems that wages increase more with education for males than
females.

Does our data support this last hypothesis? We will test this using
statsmodels' formulas
(http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/stable/example_formulas.html).
