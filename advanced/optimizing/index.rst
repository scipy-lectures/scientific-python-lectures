Optimization workflow
======================

#. Make it work: write the code in a simple **legible** ways.

#. Make it work reliably: write automated test cases, make really sure
   that your algorithm is right and that if you break it, the tests will
   capture the breakage.

#. Optimize the code by profiling simply use-cases to find the
   bottlenecks and speeding up these bottleneck, finding a
   better algorithm or implementation.

Profiling Python code
==========================================

.. topic:: **No optimization without measuring!**

    * **Measure:** profiling, timing

    * You'll have surprises: the fastest code is not always what you
      think


Timeit
---------

In IPython, use ``timeit`` (http://docs.python.org/library/timeit.html) to time elementary operations:

.. sourcecode:: ipython
    
    In [1]: import numpy as np

    In [2]: a = np.arange(1000)

    In [3]: %timeit a**2
    100000 loops, best of 3: 5.73 us per loop

    In [4]: %timeit a**2.1
    1000 loops, best of 3: 154 us per loop

    In [5]: %timeit a*a
    100000 loops, best of 3: 5.56 us per loop

Use this to guide your choice between strategies.

Profiler
-----------

Useful when you have a large program to profile, for example the
:download:`following file <demo.py>`:

.. literalinclude:: demo.py

In IPython we can time the script:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [1]: %run -t demo.py

   IPython CPU timings (estimated):
       User  :    14.3929 s.
       System:   0.256016 s.

and profile it:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [2]: %run -p demo.py

         916 function calls in 14.551 CPU seconds

Clearly the ``svd`` (in `decomp.py`) is what takes most of our time, a.k.a. the
bottleneck. We have to find a way to make this step go faster, or to avoid this
step (algorithmic optimization). Spending time on the rest of the code is
useless.

Line-profiler
--------------

The profiler is great: it tells us which function takes most of the time,
but not where it is called.

For this, we use the 
`line_profiler <http://packages.python.org/line_profiler/>`_: in the
source file, we decorate a few functions that we want to inspect with
``@profile`` (no need to import it)::

    @profile
    def test():
	data = np.random.random((5000, 100))
	u, s, v = linalg.svd(data)
	pca = np.dot(u[:10, :], data) 
	results = fastica(pca.T, whiten=False)

Then we run the script using the `kernprof.py
<http://packages.python.org/line_profiler/kernprof.py>`_ program, with switches `-`
and `-v`::

    ~ $ kernprof.py -l -v demo.py

    Wrote profile results to demo.py.lprof
    Timer unit: 1e-06 s

    File: demo.py
    Function: test at line 5
    Total time: 14.2793 s

    Line #      Hits         Time  Per Hit   % Time  Line Contents

	5                                           @profile

	8         1     14242163 14242163.0   99.7      u, s, v = linalg.svd(data)
	9         1        10282  10282.0      0.1      pca = np.dot(u[:10, :], data)

**The SVD is taking all the time.** We need to optimise this line.

Making code go faster
======================

Once we have identified the bottlenecks, we need to make the
corresponding code go faster.

Algorithmic optimization
-------------------------

The first thing to look for is algorithmic optimization: are there ways
to compute less, or better?

For a high-level view of the problem, a good understanding of the
maths behind the algorithm helps. However, it is not uncommon to find
simple changes, like **moving a computation outside a for loop**, that
bring in big gains.

Example of the SVD
...................

In both examples above, the SVD - 
`Singular Value Decomposition <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition>`_ 
- is what
takes most of the time. Indeed, the computational cost of this algorithm is 
roughly :math:`n^3` in the size of the input matrix.

However, in both of these example, we are not using all the output of
the SVD, but only the first few rows of its first return argument. If
we use the ``svd`` implementation of scipy, we can ask for an incomplete
version of the SVD. Note that implementations of linear algebra in
scipy are richer then those in numpy and should be preferred.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [3]: %timeit np.linalg.svd(data)
    1 loops, best of 3: 14.5 s per loop

    In [4]: from scipy import linalg

    In [5]: %timeit linalg.svd(data)
    1 loops, best of 3: 14.2 s per loop

    In [6]: %timeit linalg.svd(data, full_matrices=False)
    1 loops, best of 3: 295 ms per loop

    In [7]: %timeit np.linalg.svd(data, full_matrices=False)
    1 loops, best of 3: 293 ms per loop

Real incomplete SVDs, e.g. computing only the first 10 eigenvectors, can
be computed with arpack, available in ``scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh``.

.. topic:: Computational linear algebra

    For certain algorithms, many of the bottlenecks will be linear
    algebra computations. In this case, using the right function to solve
    the right problem is key. For instance, an eigenvalue problem with a
    symmetric matrix is easier to solve than with a general matrix. Also,
    most often, you can avoid inverting a matrix and use a less costly
    (and more numerically stable) operation.

    Know your computational linear algebra. When in doubt, explore
    ``scipy.linalg``, and use ``%timeit`` to try out different alternatives
    on your data.

Writing faster numerical code
===============================

A complete discussion on advanced use of numpy is found in chapter
:ref:`advanced_numpy`, or in the article `The NumPy array: a structure
for efficient numerical computation
<http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00564007/en>`_ by van der Walt et al. Here we
discuss only some commonly encountered tricks to make code faster.

* **Vectorizing for loops**

  Find tricks to avoid for loops using numpy arrays. For this, masks and
  indices arrays can be useful.

* **Broadcasting**

  Use :ref:`broadcasting <broadcasting>` to do operations on arrays as
  small as possible before combining them.

.. XXX: complement broadcasting in the numpy chapter with the example of
   the 3D grid

* **In place operations**

  .. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [1]: a = np.zeros(1e7)

    In [2]: %timeit global a ; a = 0*a
    10 loops, best of 3: 111 ms per loop

    In [3]: %timeit global a ; a *= 0
    10 loops, best of 3: 48.4 ms per loop

  **note**: we need `global a` in the timeit so that it work, as it is
  assigning to `a`, and thus considers it as a local variable.

* **Be easy on the memory: use views, and not copies**

  Copying big arrays is as costly as making simple numerical operations
  on them:

  .. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [1]: a = np.zeros(1e7)

    In [2]: %timeit a.copy()
    10 loops, best of 3: 124 ms per loop

    In [3]: %timeit a + 1
    10 loops, best of 3: 112 ms per loop

* **Beware of cache effects**

  Memory access is cheaper when it is grouped: accessing a big array in a
  continuous way is much faster than random access. This implies amongst
  other things that **smaller strides are faster** (see
  :ref:`cache_effects`):: 

    In [1]: c = np.zeros((1e4, 1e4), order='C')

    In [2]: %timeit c.sum(axis=0)
    1 loops, best of 3: 3.89 s per loop

    In [3]: %timeit c.sum(axis=1)
    1 loops, best of 3: 188 ms per loop

    In [4]: c.strides
    Out[4]: (80000, 8)

  This is the reason why Fortran ordering or C ordering may make a big
  difference on operations. Using 
  `numexpr <http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/>`_ can be useful to 
  automatically optimize code for such effects.

* **Use compiled code**

  The last resort, once you are sure that all the high-level
  optimizations have been explored, is to transfer the hot spots, i.e.
  the few lines or functions in which most of the time is spent, to
  compiled code. For compiled code, the preferred option is to use 
  `Cython <http://www.cython.org>`_: it is easy to transform exiting
  Python code in compiled code, and with a good use of the numpy support
  yields efficient code on numpy arrays, for instance by unrolling loops.

.. warning::

   For all the above: profile and time your choices. Don't base your
   optimization on theoretical considerations.
